# FinderRefresh

A very short AppleScript exported as an application that can be used to click to refresh the OSX Finder.

This is useful for the SME File Fabric OSXFUSE Drive when data is added bi-modally to check the latest view of data without exiting the directory.

Installation

Extract the Zip on OSX and drag the Application file onto the top Finder Bar using the Alt-Command key sequence
